# CONTRIBUTING
Following these guidelines may pose you questions that help you fix the problem in the first place. Just sayin'...

Thank you for taking your time to help this little project!

## I have a question!
**Don't file an issue on the issue tracker!** First make sure that there isn't already a discussion, then open a new one.

## Reporting Bugs
Before you report a bug on the **github issue tracker** read these suggestions:
* First you may want to try the latest version (or the latest tagged one) of the source code.
* It will be easier if you can specify the version in which the bug is present (the commit, branch or tag).
* Be sure you didn't make the bug in the first place by modifing the code.
* Search in the github issue tracker if this problem has already been reported and add a comment on it instead.

And **follow these guidelines**:
* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**

## Suggesting New Features
* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Describe as clearly as possibile the feature**
* **Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
* **Provide some examples to better demonstrate the feature (GIFs etc)**
